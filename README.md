# Github repos

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used in the project to have multiple pages. The default page displays the list of all repositories and when a repository is clicked, the page of that repository will be opened.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/) are used to write unit tests.

Please find the images of UI in the project directory.

## How to run the app

In the project directory, you can run the following commands in that order:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Once it is started, the application should open automatically. If not, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
